   <h1>Assignment Work</h1> 
   <h2>I am sharing the small story of my school.</h2>
   <p>my school name is<b>Ali High School </b>I am the <i>topper</i> of my class. My favourite subject is Science and I like to learn about molecules like H<sub>2</sub>O or H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> etc. I got 1<sup>st</sup> position in my whole class. Science Sir explained very well about molecules but we still didn't understand and writing in wrong form then sir explain that <del>H2SO4</del> is the wrong way. Right way to write this is H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> <br/> then we complete our whole class. <hr/>My Science Sir well said: <q>One day,all your efforts and hard work will pay off</q></p>
